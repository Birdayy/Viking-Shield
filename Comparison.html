        When I was making my object with blender I decided to try and use unity and 3D builder. I found Unity to be really confusing and hard to use. I found that 3D builder didn't have enough features to make a good enough object. Blender was reasonably easy to use but had lots of tools, It could make a simple object or a very detailed object that could take days to render.

<div class="Aidan">
    As you can see, Aidan made his object in 3D builder and although there are more textures there is a clear difference in the leval of detail. This is due to 3D builder having less tools to use and not being able to properly render his object.

<div class="Ben">
    I made my object in blender which has many more tools and higher quality models. Many professionals use blender for creating 3D models in games and such. The great thing about blender is that anyone can use it, the people who use blenders range between novice and expert.
